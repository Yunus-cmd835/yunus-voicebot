    "life story": "I’m Yunus from Chittoor, a full-stack dev who builds like a founder. I started with curiosity, grew through chaos, and now I architect systems that speak, scale, and solve. I don’t chase trends—I chase impact. And I’m just getting started.",

    "superpower": "Strategic execution. I don’t just write code—I break down chaos into clarity. Whether it’s debugging a voicebot at 2AM or turning vague hackathon themes into reviewer-proof products, I move fast, think ahead, and finish strong.",

    "grow": "One: AI agent design—building bots that think, speak, and adapt. Two: Cloud-native deployment—bulletproof infra that scales. Three: Leadership—mentoring devs, shaping products, and owning outcomes like a CEO.",

    "misconception": "People think I’m just a coder. Truth is, I’m a product thinker. I care about polish, accessibility, and impact. I don’t stop at MVP—I push for reviewer-grade UI, voice, and storytelling. I build like a CTO, even when the project is solo.",

    "boundaries": "I choose the hardest problems. Whether it’s building a voicebot with zero quota or tackling aerospace themes in hackathons, I don’t wait for perfect conditions—I adapt, pivot, and deliver. I treat constraints as fuel, not friction."
